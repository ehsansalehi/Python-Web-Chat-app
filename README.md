# Python-Web-Chat-app
This project provides a simple chat app using Python and flask
to get started you have to install flask first:

pip install -r requirements.txt

then run the code:

python main.py

Then it will be accessble at: http://localhost:5000. Make sure you open the port at your firewall.
You can also have your own secret_key to save data at cache.
It also can be accessible by your global ip if you set the Port Forwarding settings in your router.
Another feature is whenever a user enters a page or sends a text it logs the activity in a text file by the time and date and user's ip address

Hope this is usefull.
